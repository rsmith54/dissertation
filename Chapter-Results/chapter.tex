\chapter[Results][Results]{Results}

This chapter presents the results of the analysis presented in the previous chapter.
We present the full set of signal region distributions after applying the $\mu$ factors derived from the fitting procedure.
We also present the systematic uncertainties in each signal region properly accounting for the correlations of the uncertainties.
As no excess is observed, we show exclusion limits in the sparticle-\lsp~ plane based on the results of the model-dependent fits and present the model-independent limits.

\section{Signal region distributions}

\input{Chapter-Analysis/scale-cut-figures}

In \cref{fig:srs_scale,fig:srg_scale,fig:src_scale}, we can see the unblinded distributions of the last scale cut used for each signal region.
These distributions include the $\mu$ normalization scale factors derived from the fitting procedure.
The systematic uncertainties are also shown.
Each plot shows the distribution from a signal model which is targetted by the given signal region.

These distributions have all cuts applied except for the cut on this scale variable, which allows us to see the additional discrimination provided by the given variable.
Since signal regions with the same numeral have identical cuts except for that on the main scale variable, we show (a) and (b) on the same figure.
The left-most (right-most) arrow shown is the location of the a (b) cut applied in the analysis.
We call these plot \textit{$N-1$} plots, where $N$ refers to the number of cuts applied in the analysis.
The full set of $N-1$ plots in the signal regions for the other variables used in the analysis are shown in \ref{app:n-1_plots}.

A figure showing a summary of the pulls in all of the SRs is shown in \ref{fig:sr_summary}.
This figure shows the integrated data and simulation values above the cut values in the N-1 plots, with the corresponding statistical and systematic uncertainties, for all signal regions simulatneously.
The systematic uncertainties will be discussed in the next section.
From this plot, we can see there is no significant excess of events over the Standard Model background.

This information is also presented in \ref{tab:p0_UL_RJR}.
The table includes the expectations from simulation before applying the $\mu$ normalization factor, as well as the model-independent limits we will discuss later.

We now consider consider the final values of the systematic uncertainties.

\section{Systematic Uncertainties}

This section considers the results of \ref{tab:BreakdownSysSRCompressed_RJR}.
This table is a summary of the resulting systematic uncertainties on the background estimation in each signal region, properly accounting for systematic uncertainties.
These uncertainties are expressed both as a relative uncertainty and absolute uncertainty.
As correlations are properly treated, the absolute uncertainties do not add in quadrature, although most uncertainties are relatively uncorrelated.
%Example correlation matrices are shown for SRC1, SRG1a, and SRS1a in \ref{}
%These show the pairwise correlation factors between each systematic uncertainty included in the fitting procedure \todo{remove ones that aren't actually in the tables}
We discuss the general trends in the systematic uncertainties for each type of signal region.

In the squark regions, the total uncertainties range from 10\% to 11\%.
We note that the uncertainties on the $Z$, both theoretical and $\Delta_{\mu,\mathrm{Z+jets}}$ account for the largest on the background estimate in each signal region.
The $\kappa$ factor uncertainty, which is also an uncertainty on the $Z$ estimate, is also significant at 4\% in each region.
The \Zvv contribution to the squark regions is the primary irreducible background, so even when relatively well-measured, the uncertainty on its event yield dominates the overall uncertainty.
There are also significant uncertainties from the $W$, top, and flat diboson uncertainties, although these are subdominant.
We note that the uncertainty due to statistics of the MC simulation samples are very small for the squark case; this is a reflection of the ``looseness'' of these regions, as the MC statistics are sufficient for all of the major backgrounds.

The gluino regions have overall larger uncertainties than the squark regions, between 10\% and 25\%. due to a multitude of factors.
The $Z$ related uncertainties all contribute significantly to the final background yield uncertainties.
These are relatively similar to the squark $Z$ uncertainties.
The $W$, top, and diboson uncertainties are all significantly more important than in the squark case however.
In the gluino case, we also see that the limited simulation statistics begin to significantly affect the measurement of the Standard Model background.
These are all reflections of the overall ``tighter'' quality of the gluino regions, as indicated by the event yields.
The $\Delta_{\mu}$ uncertainties are affected by this due to the need to use overall looser control regions, while the theory uncertainties are more affected by small statistical fluctuations between different generators.
The low statistics is particularly clear in SRG3b, where the simulation statistics account for a very large 14\% uncertainty.

The compressed regions have systematic uncertainties ranging from 10\% to 19\%.
For the tighter regions, SRC1, SRC4, and SRC5, we see a large contribution from the lack of MC statistics.
SRC1 and SRC4 should a large value for the $W$ theory uncertainty, while all compressed regions show a large uncertainty on the $Z$ estimate.
These large uncertainties result from the fact that we are probing extreme phase space in boson \pt with the compressed regions.
SRC5 shows large top and jet/\met uncertainties; these uncertainties are more pronounced in this region than the other compressed region due to the $\NVjet > 3$ cut, and thus the uncertainty in this region is quite affected by fluctuations in the top, jet, or \met uncertainties.

\section{Limits and Model-dependent Exclusions}

In Table \ref{tab:BreakdownSysSRCompressed_RJR}, we show the statistical significance Z for each signal region.
We calculate this using the fitted simulation mean compared with the observed event counts in each region.
There is no significant excess in each region; the highest excess is in SRG3b, which is only $Z_{\text{SRG3b}} = 1.55$.
This information is summarized in \ref{fig:sr_summary}.
We thus set model-independent and model-dependent limits.

\begin{figure}[tbph]

\input{Chapter-Results/summary-table}

As no significant excess is observed in any of the signal regions of this analysis after estimating the background using the background-only fit, we set limits on the model-independent and model-dependent cross sections.

The model-independent limits are shown in \ref{tab:BreakdownSysSRCompressed_RJR}.
We present the limits on the new physics cross section in each SR.
%These model-independent limits have no limitations based on the expected signal models.
The observed and expected limits \sobs and \sexp are reported for the potential contribution from new physics in each region.
Including the acceptance $\epsilon$, the model-independent limits in most signal regions are of $\order 1-2$ fb.
One should note that the (b) version of each signal region is strictly tighter in the primary scale cut, and thus provides a stronger limit when we observe no excess, as seen here.

Additionally, we derive exclusion limits for the simplified models considered in this thesis.
These are the models with pair-production of squark pairs with inaccessible gluinos, and gluino pairs with inaccessible squarks.
They correspond directly to the Feynman diagrams shown previously.
The free parameters of these simplified models are the relevant sparticle mass and the mass of the LSP \lsp.
We set limits in a plane of these free parameters.

The exclusion limits are shown in \ref{fig:sensitivitytext}.
Gray text is imposed on the plane at the point of each simplified model with masses $(m_{\mathrm{sparticle}}, m_{\lsp})$.
This gray text indicates the signal region which provided the best sensitivity at that point, as measured by the background-only fit.
For each simplified signal model, we run the model-dependent fit described in the last chapter, where the signal model signal strength $\mu_{\mathrm{sig}}$ is included as an additional free parameter.
The signal sample is also allowed to freely contribute to the control regions due to signal contamination.
This produces a CL$_s$ $p-$value for each signal model in the plane, and we can find those with $p = 0.05$ to set a 95\% exclusion limit.
%The simultaneous fit in the control and signal region produces a set of normalization parameters $\mu$ for each Standard Model background as well as the signal strength $\mu_{\mathrm{sig}}$ for the particular signal model of interest.

In the squark-\lsp~ plane, we observe that the limits from the 2015 dataset are far extended in all directions.
The expected and observed exclusions are similar, which is a reflection of the compatability of the expected Standard Model event counts and observed event counts in the squark regions.
A squark with mass of 1350 \GeV or less is excluded by the analysis in direct decays to a quark and LSP.
In the compressed spectra, we have extended limits significantly over the 2015 result in the region of 600-700 \GeV in squark mass with an LSP of 450 \GeV to 600 \GeV.
We note that directly along the kinematically-forbidden diagonal, the shape of the exclusions is affected by the interpolation between the signal models considered.
This could be rectified by inclusion of additional compressed signal models.
The limits in the intermediate with an LSP of \order 450-500 \GeV are not far extended beyond the previous dataset.
We also not that every signal region designed to provide sensitivity to this simplified model (all SRS regions and SRC1-4)  is chosen as the best region at least once in the plane, indicating that each signal region provided additional sensitivity to squark phenomena.

Another curiosity is the fact that a gluino region, SRG2a is chosen as the optimal region in the squark-\lsp~ plane, when the squark mass is \order 700 \GeV.
Generally, the squark regions are looser than the gluino regions, as seen in their overall event counts.
One could see this as an indication that the next iteration of the analysis should have an additional tight squark region here.
Another possibility is that this region also benefits from the compressed region strategy of using an ISR jet.
As the gluino regions require four jets from the imposition of the gluino decay tree, these could be capturing events where a two jet ISR system recoils off the disquark system.

In the gluino-\lsp~ plane, the limits on gluino masses in the simplified model where gluinos decay to two jets and an \lsp~ are again far extended beyond the 2015 dataset.
We note in most of the plane, the expected limit is significantly stronger than the observed limit; for example, the gluino mass limit is more than 50\GeV stronger in the case of a massless \lsp~.
As much of the phase space is covered by SRG3a and SRG3b, this results from the small statistical fluctuation upward in these regions.
Again, we note that every gluino signal region is the best choice at some point in this plane.
This is an indication of the utility of the signal region strategy employed in this thesis, as each point provides additional sensitivity to new SUSY models.
