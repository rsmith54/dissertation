\section{Quantum Field Theory}

\todo{cite Yuval's lectures and notes somehow}

In this section, we provide a brief overview of the necessary concepts from Quantum Field Theory (QFT).

In modern physics, the laws of nature are described by the ``action'' $S$, with the imposition of the principle of minimum action. \todo{cite}
The action is the integral over the spacetime coordinates of the ``Lagrangian density'' \Lagr, or Lagrangian for short.
The Lagrangian is a function of ``fields''; general fields will be called $\phi(x^\mu)$, where the indices $\mu$ run over the space-time coordinates.
We can then write the action $S$ as

\begin{equation}
S = \int d^4 x \Lagr[ \phi_i(x^\mu) , \dmu \phi_i(x^\mu)]
\end{equation}

where we have an additional summation over $i$ (of the different fields).
Generally, we impose the following constraints on the Lagrangian :

\begin{enumerate}
\item Translational invariance - The Lagrangian is only a function of the fields $\phi$ and their derivatives $\dmu \phi$
\item Locality - The Lagrangian is only a function of one point $x_\mu$ in spacetime.
\item Reality condition - The Lagrangian is real to conserve probability.
\item Lorentz invariance - The Lagrangian is invariant under the \Poincare group of spacetime.
\item Analyticity - The Lagrangian is an analytical function of the fields; this is to allow the use of pertubation theory.
\item Invariance and Naturalness - The Lagrangian is invariant under some internal symmetry groups; in fact, the Lagrangian will have \textit{all} terms allowed by the imposed symmetry groups. \todo{maybe add in ref here}
\item Renormalizabilty - The Lagrangian will be renormalizable - in practice, this means there will not be terms with more than power 4 in the fields.
\end{enumerate}

The key item from the point of view of this thesis is that of ``Invariance and Natural''.
We impose a set of ``symmetries'' and then our Lagragian is the most general which is allowed by those symmetries.

\section{Symmetries}

Symmetries can be seen as the fundamental guiding concept of modern physics.
Symmetries are described by ``groups''. \todo{cite?}.
To illustrate the importance of symmetries and their mathematical description, groups, we start here with two of the simplest and most useful examples :  \Ztwo and $U(1)$.

\subsection{\Ztwo symmetry}

\Ztwo symmetry is the simplest example of a ``discrete'' symmetry.
Consider the most general Lagrangian of a single real scalar field $\phi(x_\mu)$

\begin{equation} \label{scalarFieldLagrangian}
\Lagr_\phi = \frac{1}{2} \dmu \phi \dmuup \phi - \frac{m^2}{2} \phi^2 - \frac{\mu}{2 \sqrt{2}}  \phi^3 - \lambda \phi^4
\end{equation}

Now we \textit{impose} the symmetry
\begin{equation}
\Lagr(\phi) = \Lagr(- \phi)
\end{equation}

This has the effect of restricting the allowed terms of the Lagrangian.
In particular, we can see the term $\phi^3 \rightarrow - \phi^3$ under the symmetry transformation, and thus must be disallowed by this symmetry.
This means under the imposition of this particular symmetry, our Lagrangian should be rewritten as

\begin{equation}
\Lagr_\phi = \frac{1}{2} \dmu \phi \dmuup \phi - \frac{m^2}{2} \phi^2  - \lambda \phi^4
\end{equation}

The effect of this symmetry is that the total number of  $\phi$ particles can only change by even numbers, since the only interaction term $\lambda \phi^4$ is an even power of the field.
This symmetry is often imposed in supersymmetric theories, as we will see in Chapter 3.

\subsection{$U(1)$ symmetry}

$U(1)$ is the simplest example of a ``continuous'' (or Lie) group.
Now consider a theory with a single complex scalar field $\phi = \operatorname{Re}\phi + i \operatorname{Im}\phi$

\begin{equation}
\Lagr_\phi = \delta_{i,j} \frac{1}{2} \dmu \phi_i \dmuup \phi_j - \frac{m^2}{2} \phi_i \phi_j - \frac{\mu}{2 \sqrt{2}}  \phi_i \phi_j \phi_k  - \lambda \phi_i \phi_j \phi_k \phi_l
\end{equation}

where $i,j,k,l = Re, Im$.
In this case, we impose the following $U(1)$ symmetry : $\phi \rightarrow e^{i\theta}, \phi^* \rightarrow e^{-i\theta} $.
We see immediately that this again disallows the third-order terms, and we can write a theory of a complex scalar field with $U(1)$ symmetry as

\begin{equation}
\Lagr_\phi =  \dmu \phi \dmuup \phi^* - \frac{m^2}{2} \phi \phi^* -   - \lambda (\phi \phi^*)^2
\end{equation}

\section{Local symmetries}

The two examples considered above are ``global'' symmetries in the sense that the symmetry transformation does not depends on the spacetime coordinate $x_\mu$.
We know look at local symmetries; in this case, for example with a local $U(1)$ symmetry,  the transformation has the form $\phi(x_\mu) \rightarrow e^{i \theta(\x_mu)} \phi(x_\mu)$.
These symmetries are also known as ``gauge'' symmetries; all symmetries of the Standard Model are gauge symmetries.

There are wide-ranging consequences to the imposition of local symmetries.
To begin, we note that the derivative terms of the Lagrangian \ref{scalarFieldLagrangian} are \textit{not} invariant under a local symmetry transformation
\begin{equation}
\dmu \phi(x_\mu) \rightarrow \dmu ( e^(i\theta(x_\mu) \phi(x_\mu )) = (1 + i \theta(x_\mu) ) e^(i\theta(x_\mu) \phi(x_\mu )
\end{equation}\todo {GET THIS RIGHT}

This leads us to note that the kinetic terms of the Lagrangian are also not invariant under a gauge symmetry.
This would lead to a model with no dynamics, which is clearly unsatisfactory.

Let us take inspiration from the case of global symmetries.
We need to define a so-called ``covariant'' derivative $D^\mu$ such that

\begin{equation}
D^\mu \phi   \rightarrow e^{ i q \theta(x^\mu) D^\mu \phi} \\
D^\mu \phi^* \rightarrow e^{-i q \theta(x^\mu) D^\mu \phi} \\
\end{equation}

Since $\phi$ and$\phi^*$ transforms with the opposite phase, this will lead the invariance of the Lagrangian under our local gauge transformation.
This $D^\mu$ is of the following form

\begin{equation}
D^\mu = \dmu - i g q A^\mu
\end{equation}

where $A^\mu$ is a vector field we introduce with the transformation law

\begin{equation}
A^\mu \rightarrow A^\mu - \frac{1}{g} \dmu \theta
\end{equation}

and $g $ is the coupling constant associated to vector field.
This vector field $A^\mu$ is also known as a ``gauge'' field.

Since we need to add all allowed terms to the Lagrangian, we define

\begin{equation}
F^{\mu\nu} = A^\mu A^\nu - A^\nu A^\mu
\end{equation}

and then we must also add the kinetic term :

\begin{equation}
\Lagr_{\text{gauge}} = - \frac{1}{4} F^{\mu\nu} F_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}

The most general renormalizable Lagrangian with fermion and scalar fields can be written in the following form

\begin{equation}
\Lagr = \Lagr_{kin} + \Lagr_{\phi} + \Lagr_\psi +   \Lagr{Yukawa}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism}

Here we view some examples of symmetry breaking.
We investigate breaking of a global $U(1)$ symmetry and a local $U(1)$ symmetry.
The SM will break the electroweak symmetry $SU(2) x U(1)$, and in Chapter 3 we will see how supersymmetry must also be broken.

There are two ideas of symmetry breaking
\begin{itemize}
\item Explicit symmetry breaking by a small parameter - in this case, we have a small parameter which breaks an ``approximate'' symmetry of our Lagrangian.
An example would be the theory of the single scalar field \ref{scalarFieldLagrangian}, when $\mu << m^2$ and $\mu << \lambda$.
In this case, we can often ignore the small term when considering low-energy processes.
\item Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) - spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the Lagrangian is symmetric with respect to a given symmetry transformation, but the ground state of the theory is \textit{not} symmetric with respect to that transformation.
This can have some fascintating consequences, as we will see in the following examples
\end{itemize}
Symmetry breaking a

\subsubsection{U(1) global symmetry breaking}

Consider the theory of a complex scalar field under the $U(1)$ symmetry, or the transformation
\begin{equation}
\phi \rightarrow e^{i\theta} \phi
\end{equation}

The Lagrangian for this theory is
\begin{equation}
\Lagr = \dmuup \phi^{\dag} \dmu \phi + \frac{\mu^2}{2} \phi^{\dag} \phi + \frac{\lambda}{4} (\phi^\dag \phi)^2
\end{equation}

Let us write this theory in terms of two scalar fields, $h$ and $\xi$ : $\phi = (h + i\xi) / \sqrt(2)$.
The Lagrangian can then be written as
\begin{equation}
\Lagr = \dmuup h \dmu h + \dmuup \xi dmu \xi - \frac{\mu^2}{2} (h^2 + \xi^2) - \frac{\lambda}{4}(h^2 + \xi^2)^2
\end{equation}

First, note that the theory is only stable when $\lambda > 0$.
To understand the effect of SSB, we now enforce that $\mu^2 < 0$, and define $v^2 = -\mu^2/\lambda$.
We can then write the scalar potential of this theory as :
\begin{equation}
V(\phi) = \lambda (\phi^\dag \phi - v^2/2)^2
\end{equation}

Minimizing this equation with respect to $\phi$, we can see that the ``vacuum expectation value'' of the theory is
\begin{equation}
2<\phi^\dag \phi> = <h^2 + \xi^2 > = v^2
\end{equation}

We now reach the ``breaking'' point of this procedure.
In the $(h, \xi)$ plane, the minima form a circle of radius $v$.
We are free to choose any of these minima to expand our Lagrangian around; the physics is not affected by this choice.
For convenience, choose $<h> = v, <\xi^2> = 0$.

Now, let us define $h' = h - v , \xi' = \xi $ with VEVs $<h'> = 0 , <\xi'> = 0$.
We can then write our spontaneously broken Lagrangian in the form
\begin{equation}
\Lagr = \frac{1}{2} \dmu h' \dmuup h' +  \frac{1}{2} \dmu \xi' \dmuup \xi' - \lambda v^2 h'^2 - \lambda v h' (h'^2 + \xi'^2 ) - \lambda (h'^2 + \xi'^2)^2
\end{equation}

\section{The Standard Model}

\subsection{Overview}

The Standard Model is another name for the theory of the internal symmetry group $SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y$ \todo{CHECK}.
This quantum field theory is the culmination of years of work in both theoretical and particle physics.  \todo{cite}

\subsection{Field Content}

The SM field content is
\begin{equation}
\text{Fermions} Q_L(3,2)_{+1/3}, \xspace  U_R(3,1)_{+4/3},\xspace  D_R(3,1)_{-2/3} ,\xspace  L_L(1,2)_{-1} ,\xspace  E_R(1,1)_{-2}\\
\text{Scalar (Higgs)} \xspace \phi(1,2)_{+1/2} \\
\text{Vector Fields} \xspace G^\mu(8,1)_0 \xspace W^\mu(1,3)_0  \xspace B^\mu(1,1)_0
\end{equation}
where the $(A, B)_Y$ notation represents the irreducible representation under $SU(3)$ and $SU(2)$, with $Y$ being the electroweak hypercharge.
Each of these fields has an additional index, representing the three generation of fermions.

We observed that $Q_L, U_R,$ and $D_R$ are triplets under $SU(3)$; these are the \textit{quark} fields.
They are mediated by the ``gluon'' field $G^\mu(8,1)_0$.
The fermion fields $L_L(1,2)_{-1}$ and $  E_R(1,1)_{-2} $ are singlets under $SU(3)$; we call them \textit{leptons}.

Next, we note the ``left-handed'' particles, denoted by $L$, which are doublets under $SU(2)$.
This is mediated by the unification of the
This is the reflection of the ``chirality'' of the Standard Model; the left-handed and right-handed particles are treated differently by the electroweak forces.
