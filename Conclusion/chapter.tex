%This is the conclusion of the dissertation

\chapter*{Conclusion} %Your conclusion isn't a numbered chapter, so we use the asterisk here.
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion} %This command puts your conclusion in your table of contents even though we have used the asterisk in the \chapter command above.


Here you can write some introductory remarks about your chapter.
I like to give each sentence its own line.

When you need a new paragraph, just skip an extra line.

\section*{New Section}

By using the asterisk to start a new section, I keep the section from appearing in the table of contents.
If you want your sections to be numbered and to appear in the table of contents, remove the asterisk.
