%This is the conclusion of the dissertation

\chapter[Conclusion][Conclusion]{Conclusion} %Your conclusion isn't a numbered chapter, so we use the asterisk here.

Here you can write some introductory remarks about your chapter.
I like to give each sentence its own line.

When you need a new paragraph, just skip an extra line.

\section{New Section}

By using the asterisk to start a new section, I keep the section from appearing in the table of contents.
If you want your sections to be numbered and to appear in the table of contents, remove the asterisk.
