%The following command starts your introduction. 

\chapter*{Introduction} %Your introduction isn't a numbered chapter, so we use the asterisk here.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction} %This command puts your introduction in your table of contents even though we have used the asterisk in the \chapter command above.

\section{New Section}

By using the asterisk to start a new section, I keep the section from appearing in the table of contents.
If you want your sections to be numbered and to appear in the table of contents, remove the asterisk.
