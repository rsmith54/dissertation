\AtlasAbstract{%
  This document discusses how to use \BibTeX\ for the bibliography of your ATLAS paper.
  It covers what to pay attention to when creating references and how to get round common problems.
  Standard \texttt{.bib} bibliography files are provided
  which contain all ATLAS and CMS journal publications as well as ATLAS CONF and PUB notes.

  Use of both \Package{biblatex} and the more traditional \BibTeX\ for formatting the references is covered.
  A \Package{biblatex} style file and two \BibTeX\ (\texttt{.bst}) style files have been created 
  that can be used with any of the ATLAS supported journals,
  depending on whether they require the title of the references to be included or not.

  This document was generated using version \ATPackageVersion\ of the ATLAS \LaTeX\ package.
  The \TeX\ Live version is set to \ATTeXLiveVersion.
  It uses the option \Option{atlasstyle}, which implies that the standard ATLAS preprint style is used.

\section{Introduction}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ATLAS Collaboration has specific guidelines as to what constitutes a good bibliographic style. 
For example, a reference to a paper by an LHC Collaboration must not include the first author,
whereas, if the paper is by any other collaboration it should. 
Where available, links to the \texttt{arXiv} entries of the papers should be included. 
To help authors with their paper preparations,
a standard ATLAS bibliographic style has been developed which incorporates all of these requirements, 
and, at the same time, is largely compatible with those of the journals the papers are being submitted to. 

It is strongly recommended to use \BibTeX{} for the references. 
Although it often appears harder to use at the beginning, it means that the number of
typos should be reduced significantly and the format of the references
will be correct, without you having to worry about formatting it.
In addition the order of the references is automatically correct.
Files which contain ATLAS and CMS journal publications
as well as ATLAS CONF and PUB notes in \BibTeX{} format are provided -- see \Sect{\ref{sec:atlascmsrefs}}.

A new implementation of \BibTeX\ is provided by the \Package{biblatex}~\cite{biblatex} package.
All ATLAS documents use this package now by default.
One major advantage of the package is that it defines quite a few more entry types
that are much more suitable for online documents and things like CONF and PUB notes.
Adjustment of the style is also much simpler.
It is possible to take a base style and then just apply changes to it rather than
having to learn the details of how \texttt{bst} files are constructed.

The nomenclature is rather confusing as the package \Package{biblatex} can use
either \texttt{biber} or \texttt{bibtex} to process your \texttt{.bib} files.
There are 3 possible cases that will be considered here:
\begin{enumerate}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
  \item \texttt{biblatex} + \texttt{biber};
  \item \texttt{biblatex} + \texttt{bibtex};
  \item Traditional \BibTeX with \texttt{bibtex};
\end{enumerate}
2. is the default for ATLAS. You can change to the \texttt{biber} backend (alternative 1.) by passing the option
\Option{backend=biber} to \Package{atlaspackage}. 
Use of traditional \BibTeX\ (alternative 3.) is deprecated.
However, the templates indicate via commented out commands how to use it.
If you use the \texttt{biber} backend, it is also possible to use UTF-8 encoding in the entries, which means that letters such as
ä, é, ß can be included directly in the text.

The typical compilation cycle when using \Package{biblatex} with the \texttt{bibtex} backend 
or the traditional version of \BibTeX{} looks like the following:
%
\begin{verbatim}
  pdflatex mydocument
  bibtex mydocument
  pdflatex mydocument
  pdflatex mydocument
\end{verbatim}
If you use \Package{biblatex} with the backend \Package{biber} rather than \Package{bibtex}, replace the command
\texttt{bibtex} with \texttt{biber}.

\texttt{biber} and \texttt{bibtex} create a file with the extension \texttt{.bbl}, which
contains the actual references used, and (pdf)\LaTeX{} then takes care to include them in your document. 
Note that only after the third run of pdf\LaTeX\ will all references be correct. 
Unless you change a reference you do not have to do the \texttt{bibtex/biber} step again.
The style of the references is governed by the \Package{biblatex} options that you
use or the \BibTeX\ style file (which has the extension \File{bst}).

You can of course use \LaTeX\ rather than pdf\LaTeX, but pdf\LaTeX\ is preferred,
as things like clicking on cross-references and links to publications in the bibliography
work much more reliably with pdf\LaTeX.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Bibliography databases}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One or more files with the extension \texttt{.bib} should contain all the references. 
The files may also contain references that you do not use, so they act like a library of references.
See \Sect{\ref{sec:atlascmsrefs}} for details on files which contain ATLAS and CMS journal publications
as well as ATLAS CONF and PUB notes.

You should check that you base your \File{.bib} file on the examples provided,
as they have the references in the style recommended for ATLAS publications.
This will definitely save time in the reviewing process!

If you use \Package{biblatex}, you should include commands like:
%
\begin{verbatim}
  \addbibresource{bibtex/bib/ATLAS.bib}
  \addbibresource{atlas_biblatex.bib}
\end{verbatim}
%
in the preamble of our document.

If you use traditional \BibTeX\ you include the source file(s) at the place where the bibliography should be printed as follows:
%
\begin{verbatim}
{\raggedright
  \bibliography{bibtex/bib/ATLAS,%
  atlas_biblatex}
}
\end{verbatim}

If you use \Package{atlaspackage}, then \Package{biblatex} is used with the \texttt{bibtex} backend by default.
Turn off the use with the option \Option{biblatex=false}.

If you want to use the \Package{biber} backend, include \Package{atlaspackage} with the option \Option{backend=biber} and
use the command \texttt{biber} instead of \texttt{bibtex} to process the \texttt{.bib} files.
Note that \texttt{biber} returns an error if it encounters an empty \texttt{.bib} file.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Databases with ATLAS and CMS references}
\label{sec:atlascmsrefs}

Four database files with all ATLAS and CMS journal references as well as
ATLAS CONF and PUB notes are provided:
\begin{description}
\item[ATLAS.bib] the citation key is the ATLAS reference code, e.g.\ \texttt{HIGG-2012-27};
\item[CMS.bib] the citation key is the CMS reference code, e.g.\ \texttt{CMS-HIG-12-036};
\item[ConfNotes.bib] the citation key is the CONF note number, e.g.\ \texttt{ATLAS-CONF-2014-063};
\item[PubNotes.bib] the citation key is the PUB note number, e.g.\ \texttt{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021}.
\end{description}
These are available in the directory \File{bibtex/bib} of \Package{atlaslatex}.
However, these files are only updated when a new version of \Package{atlaslatex} is released.
Up-to-date versions are available from the PubCom TWiki~\cite{pubcom-refs}.
The files are updated once per month and all entries have been checked for correct formatting.
You are strongly encouraged to use these files and not try to maintain your own copies of
such publications.

As of Version 01-07-02 of \Package{atlaslatex}, ATLAS journal publications, CONF and PUB notes as well as
CMS publications are available.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Extracting used database entries}
\label{sec:bibtool}

At some point you may want to create a bibliography database that only contains the references you are actually using in a document.
You can do this using the \File{bibtool} program.
Giving the command:
\begin{verbatim}
bibtool -x mydocument.aux -o refs.bib
\end{verbatim}
will extract the entries that you use and in future you can use and
correct \texttt{refs.bib}, which only contains the references that you
actually cite.\footnote{%
I got this tip from
\url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/417/how-to-split-all-bibtex-referenced-entries-from-a-big-bibtex-database-to-a-copy}. Do
not forget to change \texttt{mydocument.tex}, or whatever your main filename is, to use
\texttt{refs.bib} instead of the previous sources.}

For Debian/Ubuntu distributions you should be able to install \File{bibtool} by giving the command\\
\verb|(sudo) apt-get install bibtool|. 
For RPM-based Linux (CentOS, Scientific Linux, Fedora, ...) distributions the equivalent command is \verb|yum install BibTool|.
On a Mac, you can install it via MacPorts: \verb|(sudo) port install BibTool|.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{ATLAS bibliography style files}
\label{sec:atlasbst}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The format of the references in your ATLAS paper depends on the journal to which you are submitting,
but in general we can classify the journal styles in two categories: 
those which require the title of the references and those which do not. 
To ensure the homogeneity in all ATLAS publications, 
\Package{biblatex} and \BibTeX\ style files are provided for each of these categories 
along with an example file that illustrates how different types of bibliographic material should be referenced.

The \Package{biblatex} style file can be found in the directory \File{latex},
while the traditional \BibTeX\ style files can be found in the directory \File{bibtex/bst} of the \Package{atlaslatex} package.

For the final version of ATLAS notes, both internal and public, a style without the title for papers in journals is recommended.
For draft versions, it is good to include the title, as it is then clearer what the reference refers to.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\Package{biblatex} style file}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use \Package{biblatex} the basic options are set in \Package{latex/atlaspackage.sty}.
A few adjustments are made in the style file \Package{latex/atlasbiblatex.sty},
which you should include with a normal \Macro{usepackage} command.
By default, this style includes the document title.
The title can be turned off by including the option \Option{articletitle=false}.
This option turns off the title for entry types \texttt{@Article}, \texttt{@Booklet} and \texttt{@Report},
as \texttt{@Booklet} should be used as the entry type for CONF and PUB notes.
A summary of the options is:
\begin{description}
\item[\Option{articletitle=true|false}] turn on (default) or off including the article title in the bibliography;
\item[\Option{titlequote=true|false}] enclose the title in quotes instead of emphasize (default);
\item[\Option{showdoi=true|false}] make the journal reference a link to the DOI instead of displaying it (default);
\item[\Option{eprint=true|false}] print the arXiv reference if available (default).
\item[\Option{block=ragged|space|none}] use \Macro{raggedright} (default) for typesetting the references.
  Alternatives are \Option{block=space} and \Option{block=none}.
  The default option (\Option{ragged}) tries to fit the title into a single line 
  and so sometimes leads to a new line starting immediately after the author.
\item[\Option{texlive=YYYY}] set if you use an older version of \TeX\ Live like 2009.
  This option is usually set in the document class.
\end{description}

With \Package{biblatex}, notes are printed after the journal reference and before the arXiv or URL.
If you want the note to be printed after the arXiv or URL, use the \texttt{adddendum} rather than the \texttt{note} field.
The \texttt{addendum} field is ignored by traditional \BibTeX.

To print the bibliography include the command:
%
\begin{verbatim}
  \printbibliography
\end{verbatim}
%
where it should get printed.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Traditional \BibTeX\ style files}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use traditional \BibTeX, you should choose between the two style files given below, 
depending on the journal to which they wish to submit their paper.
These style files have been successfully tested in the framework provided by 
the journals listed in the following sections and with the standard ATLAS document template.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{\BibTeX\ style file for journals with the title in the reference}

\BibTeX\ style file: \Package{atlasBibStyleWithTitle.bst}.
Journals:
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \textbf{JHEP}
\item \textbf{JINST}
\item \textbf{NJP}
\end{itemize}
\noindent Include at the end of your \File{.tex} file the following lines:
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliographystyle{bibtex/bst/atlasBibStyleWithTitle}
\bibliography{atlas-bibtex}
\end{verbatim}

You can use the \BibTeX\ style \File{JHEP.bst} for papers that are supposed to be submitted to JHEP.
However, note that JHEP only prints the arXiv entry etc.\ if the entry type is \texttt{@Article}.
In the examples included in this document,
the entry type \texttt{@Booklet} is used for preprints and CONF notes,
as this works best with other \BibTeX\ styles.
If you are planning to submit to JHEP/JINST and use \File{JHEP.bst} 
replace all \texttt{@Booklet} entry types with \texttt{@Article}.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{\BibTeX\ style file for journals without the title in the reference}

\BibTeX\ style file: \Package{atlasBibStyleWoTitle.bst}.
Journals:
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \textbf{EPJC}
\item \textbf{NPB}
\item \textbf{PLB}
\item \textbf{PRD}
\item \textbf{PRL}
\end{itemize}
\noindent Include at the end of your \File{.tex} file the following lines:
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliographystyle{bibtex/bst/atlasBibStyleWoTitle}
\bibliography{atlas-bibtex}
\end{verbatim}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Journal names}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is often the case that one sees several different abbreviations for journal
names in one set of references.
In order to try to get round this problem, macros are defined that
contain the standard abbreviations.
It is then also possible to modify the abbreviation if a journal uses a different convention from ours.

The abbreviations can be found in the style file \File{latex/atlasjournal.sty},
which is included by default if you load \Package{atlasphysics}.
If you use traditional \BibTeX, you should give the journal name in the form
\verb|journal = "\PLB{}",|. 
If you use \Package{biblatex} the form \verb|journal = "\PLB",| works without problems.
This style file also defines several other abbreviations that can be adjusted to the
journal style. 
Standard sets for different journals can be provided by an option in the future.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{References from Inspire}
\label{sc:inquire}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A common way to find a reference is using Inspire~\cite{inspire}.
You can select the output format as BibTeX and simply copy the result(s) to your \File{.bib} file.
In order that the reference follows the ATLAS conventions you need to do the following,
assuming that the reference is for an LHC collaboration paper:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Change the field name \texttt{author} to \texttt{xauthor}.
\item Change the field name \texttt{collaboration} to \texttt{author} and write the collaboration in the form\\
  \verb|"{ATLAS Collaboration}"|. Note the use of both quotes and curly braces.
\item Either replace the journal name with the appropriate macro, e.g.\ \verb|"Phys.Lett."| with
  \verb|"\PLB"|; or insert spaces between the parts of the name, i.e.\ \verb|"Phys. Lett."|.
%  Note the use of \verb|\ | (you can also use \verb|{}|) instead of just a space, 
%  as a regular interword space should be inserted and not an end of sentence space.
\item Remove the journal letter from the volume and include it in the journal,
  e.g.\ "\EPJC", "\PRD". 
\end{enumerate}
If the reference is for another collaboration, rename the \texttt{collaboration} field to
\texttt{xcollaboration} and insert \verb|{NonLHC Collaboration} and| at the beginning of the 
\texttt{author} field.

Instead of renaming the \texttt{author} or \texttt{collaboration} fields, you can of course simply delete them!
Do not comment the lines out, as comment lines are not recognised inside \BibTeX\ entries.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Bibliography database tips}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{itemize}
\item A bibliographic item is created in the \File{.bib} file as:
\begin{verbatim}
@Article{lhcCollaboration:2012,
  author = "...",
  title  = "...",
  further bibliographic information}
}
\end{verbatim}
  The identifier directly after the document type declaration is how one should refer to this item inside the main \File{.tex} file.
  Use a non-breaking space between the citation and the reference, i.e.\
  \verb|... measured previously~\cite{lhcCollaboration:2012}|.
\item When referencing ATLAS CONF notes, the URL to the CDS page should be included.
  For this to work, in the preamble of your \File{.tex} document add
  \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage\{hyperref\}}.
  Note that \Package{hyperref} is included by default if you use \Package{atlasdoc} and/or \Package{atlaspackage}.
\item Depending on the style that is used,
  if the DOI is filled and the \texttt{hyperref} package loaded, 
  the title of the journal can be highlighted in blue and become a hyperlink to the online paper.
\item When referencing papers from journals like PRD, PLB, etc.,
  one has to be careful not to include the \enquote{D} or \enquote{B} as part of the volume.
  Instead these belong to the journal name. 
  You can either use the macros that have been added to the \File{.bst} style files for these journals, or
  the macros defined in \Package{atlasjournal}.
  If you want to use \Package{biblatex} or other \File{bst} files, it is probably better to use the
  \Package{atlasjournal} definitions.
\item Comments are not part of the bibliography database format. Text outside entries will be ignored.
  Do not try to comment out fields inside an entry!
  If there are fields that you do not want, you have to move them outside the entry.
\end{itemize}

In earlier versions of this document, it was recommended to include the \Package{cite} package, 
if you use \BibTeX\ and want to cite multiple references in the format [m-n].
However, the journal style files can do this for you by using the option \Option{sort\&compress} option if \Package{natbib} is used.
The \texttt{revtex} style also does this for you.
If you use \texttt{biblatex} use the option \Option{style=numeric-comp},
which is the default in \Package{atlaslatex}.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Examples}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{itemize}
\item LHC Collaboration~\cite{lhcCollaboration:2012}
\item Other Collaboration~\cite{otherCollaboration:2007}
\item Individual authors~\cite{authors:2008}
\item arXiv only~\cite{arxivOnly:2009}
\item arXiv only submitted to a journal~\cite{arxivSub:2011}
\item ATLAS CONF Note~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2012-058}
\end{itemize}

While the \texttt{collaboration} field is a nice idea, it is not supported by many \BibTeX\ styles.
Hence in \Ref{\cite{lhcCollaboration:2012}}, \texttt{collaboration} has been renamed to \texttt{author} and
the \texttt{author} field has been renamed as \texttt{xauthor}. If you use \texttt{collaboration} and omit
\texttt{author} you will get a warning when you run \texttt{bibtex}.

Note that in \Ref{\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2012-058}} the entry type \texttt{@Article} used to be used and the field \texttt{journal} 
was abused for the conference note number. This is a result of the traditional \BibTeX\ restrictions on the entry types.
The current version uses \texttt{@Booklet} and includes the CONF note number via the \texttt{howpublished} field.
In general, \texttt{biblatex} provides a lot more entry types.
This is one of the reasons for the  move to \texttt{biblatex} as the default for the ATLAS templates.
All \Package{atlaslatex} documentation uses \Package{biblatex} with the backend \Package{biber}.
The default for ATLAS documents is to use \Package{biblatex} with the backend \Package{bibtex}.

For papers that have been submitted to a journal, but not yet published, use the entry type \texttt{@Article}.
You should specify the journal in the \texttt{journal} field in form:\\
\texttt{journal = "submitted to \Macro{PLB}{}\{\}"} or\\
\texttt{journal = "accepted by \Macro{PLB}{}\{\}"}.
